### Hi, I'm April 👋


I'm a Senior Cloud Developer Advocate ☁🥑 and DevOps Practice Lead at [Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/) specializing in DevOps and Microsoft Azure.

Prior to joining Advocacy, I worked in Microsoft's Commercial Software Engineering team (build with/code with) working with large customers, getting them into Azure. I have been working at Microsoft for almost 4 years and have been working in tech for 20+ years. I started my careeer working in Ops and moved into the Dev space, providing a huge amount of experience to leverage my background in DevOps Principles. 

I am also a [Hashicorp Ambassador](https://www.hashicorp.com/) spending a lot of my time working with IaC. I like to spend my time making Azure and its features more consumable for us humans. I like working with PowerShell, Golang and sometimes a bit of TypeScript and C#. 

I am always looking for cool projects to get involved with and real live DevOps.
