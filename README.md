### Hi, I'm April 👋


I'm a Senior Enterprise Advocate ☁🥑 and DevOps Practice Lead at GitHub specializing in DevOps, IaC, and Microsoft Azure.

I am also a [Hashicorp Ambassador](https://www.hashicorp.com/) spending a lot of my time working with IaC. I like to spend my time making Azure and its features more consumable for us humans. I like working with PowerShell, Golang and sometimes a bit of TypeScript and C#. 

I am always looking for cool projects to get involved with and real live DevOps.

You can find me on [The DevOps Lab](https://aka.ms/TheDevOpsLab), follow the DevOps Lab on [YouTube](https://aka.ms/DevOpsLabYT) to see our latest topics and videos.
